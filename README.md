# Variance-Analysis
1. Introduction

This is the financial analysis project on budgeting management where I compare Actual vs Plan vs Forecast expenditure of IT department of company X, and conclude corresponding business insights from the dashboard I built. (Plan is the original financial plan, Actual is the real financial results, and Forecast is an estimate of future financial performance.)

Company X is a global company whose business covers 6 areas and 23 countries. This dataset shows details of the company’s actual, planed, and forecast monthly expenditure of the IT department in year 2022. The dataset covers detailed information including the Business Area, Region, Country, IT area, and cost element group.

2. Identify the problems

The financial officer approaches to the FP&A team for the insights of this year’s budget. There are three questions that she is interested in particularly:

What is the financial performance every month?

Which element cost the most expenditure?

How much difference are there between the actual expenditure and planed and forecasted ones in IT area/ business area/ country?

3. Define the strategies

Based on above problems, two main performance metrics will be calculated, which are:

- Plan vs Actual Variance = Plan - Actual

- Plan vs Actual Percentage Variance

It compares the budget figure to the actual results for a specific period of time. It can analyse how well company X adhered to its initial budget, and identifies the reasons for any differences between them. It can help in performance valuation, identifying areas of improvement, and making adjustments to future budgets based on the actual outcomes.

- Plan vs Forecast Variance = Plan - Forecast

- Plan vs Forecast Percentage Variance

It compares the budgeted figures to the forecasted ones for a specific period of time. It can help Company X adapt to changing circumstances and make informed decisions.
